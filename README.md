## bar end shifter

[thingverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4462070)

I am currently using this friction shifter to control my rear derailleur. I use a 3.5mm thick rubber washer to increase friction.

Here is a picture of an prior version which i used before switching to my electronic shifting system:

## gel clip

Instead of expensive commercially-available gel I used my own mixed of honey, agave-syrup and salt as my homemade-gel.

I made this clip to hold a flexible bottle containing this gel to my top tube and used it as my main nutrition source.

## saddle bottle holder

[thingverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4445349)

I designed this light and aerodynamic bottle holder to attach 1 or 2 bottle cages behind my saddle.

## chain catcher

I used this custom chain catcher when converting my bike to a 1x setup.

### V1

[thingverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4445369)

The first version is more customizable but a bit heavier and less aerodynamic than the V2.

### V2

[thingverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4445368)

This version isn't really customizable but is lighter and more aerodynamic than the V1.

## electronic shifting

I made this diy electronic shifting shifting system using a simple rear derailleur from which I removed the tension spring.

It used an arduino nano, a bec converter, a 20Kg servo and a small 2s lipo battery.

The servo braked after around a thousand kilometer.

### script

The script used on the arduino nano to control the shifting. As said earlier i never used a 2x setup and this script is design to control the shifting with a single button (even though it would probably be more efficient to use a button for shifting up and one for shifting down).

I put two button in parallel  (one on the aero bars and one on the base bars) to be able to shift from the two different positions.

### front derailleur

[thingverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4445362)

This is a fully custom front derailleur that's made to use a 9g servo (which might be too weak for actual use).

I printed and tested the front derailleur though i never used it since i converted my bike to a 1x setup.

### rear derailleur

[thingverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4445350)

This is the rear derailleur attachment that are made to convert a [sram x-4](https://www.sram.com/en/sram/models/rd-x4-a1) rear derailleur to a 12 speed electronic rear derailleur.

### box

[thingverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4445356)

This box is made to be screwed on a standard bottle cage mounting holes (in my case on the top tube) and to be closed with screw and threaded insert.

It is used to hold all the electronic for the shifting.

### button holder

This is made to hold a simple 6mm push button under tennis tape used as bar tape.

## brake spacer

[thingverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4445364)

My brake bianchi caliper tended to push the brake pad down when tightening the screws so i made those simple brake spacers to hold them up.
